# 🧠 Retinal Vessel Segmentation with U-Net

This repository contains code and analysis for segmenting blood vessels in retinal images using U-Net, implemented in PyTorch. The project is based on the DRIVE and STARE datasets and explores how skip connections affect model performance in identifying fine vascular structures.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

This project was completed as part of **Assignment 3** for a deep learning course. The task involved implementing, training, and evaluating two U-Net variants:

- **Model 1: U-Net with Skip Connections**  
- **Model 2: U-Net without Skip Connections**

We analyzed how architectural differences influence the segmentation of retinal blood vessels, especially **thin vessels**, which are crucial in early diagnosis of eye diseases.

## 🧪 Datasets

- **DRIVE**: Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction  
- **STARE**: Structured Analysis of the Retina  

> Datasets are preloaded on CHPC scratch disks and were used as provided—no modifications or external data used.

## 🚀 Features

- Full **U-Net architecture** with configurable depth and skip connections
- **Data augmentation**: horizontal and vertical flipping
- **Weighted loss function** to handle class imbalance (background vs. vessels)
- Visual output comparison between predictions and ground truth
- Evaluation using **F1-score**, with a target ≥ 0.75 on validation

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch ≥ 1.7
- NumPy, scikit-learn, scikit-image
- ImageIO, imagecodecs
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Results

| Model Variant         | Validation F1 Score | Observations                               |
|----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| U-Net (with skips)   | > 0.81              | Performs well on both thick and thin vessels |
| U-Net (no skips)     | < 0.75              | Misses thin vessels due to lack of detail retention |

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Skip connections are critical** for preserving spatial resolution in segmentation tasks.
- **Weighted loss functions** significantly improve performance on imbalanced datasets.
- **Simple augmentations** like flipping are highly effective for medical image training.
